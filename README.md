# WorkshopCollections
A script to make adding workshop items to collections easier.

# Installation
Be sure to have Tampermonkey or greasemonkey and click https://github.com/PatrickJnr/WorkshopCollections/raw/main/WorkshopCollections.user.js
I've only tested this in Chrome.

# How do I use this script?
1. Start creating a new collection
2. Save the title and the details of the collection
3. This script will create 2 new buttons above the table with the subscribed items. Press the green button to add all subscibed items into this collection and the red button to remove all subscribed items from this collection
4. After you press the green button, open the "Network" tab in the developer console and wait until the last request gets a "200" response.
5. Refresh the page, your collection will be updated.

All I did was turn it into a script for the use in Tampermoney or Greasemonkey
